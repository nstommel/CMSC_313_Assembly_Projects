# CMSC_313_Assembly_Projects
This repository contains several NASM x86 assembly coding projects from CMSC 313 class. The fourth project combines C with assembly. The NASM assembler for the x86 Intel/AMD architecture is necessary for building as well as the 32-bit C library package on Linux.

# Project 1
This assembly program prompts for user input and uses the rot13 ciper to encrypt/scramble the input. The converted text is printed out to the console.

# Project 2
This assembly program prompts for user input and converts octal and escape sequences found within the 512 byte memory buffer for printing in a terminal.

# Project 3
This assembly program contains a subroutine prt_dec to print an integer number given a parameter on the stack. main3.asm and mytest3.asm are used to test the subroutine.

# Project 4
This project integrates an assembly function bookcmp into a C program that sorts books by. bookcmp compares two books, returning -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether book1 is less than, equal to, or greater than book2. First book years are compared then book titles are compared by ASCII order.
